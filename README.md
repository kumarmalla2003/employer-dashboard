# Full-Stack Employee Management Application

This project is a full-stack web application for managing employee data. It consists of a React-based frontend and a Python-based backend API.

## Project Structure

-   `./frontend`: Contains the React frontend application. See the [frontend README](./frontend/README.md) for detailed instructions on how to run and develop the frontend.
-   `./backend`: Contains the Python backend API. See the [backend README](./backend/README.md) for detailed instructions on how to set up the database and run the server.

## Overview

*   **Frontend:** A modern, responsive user interface built with React, Vite, and TailwindCSS. It allows users to register, log in, and perform CRUD operations on employee records.
*   **Backend:** A RESTful API built with Python, Tornado, and MySQL. It handles user authentication, session management, and all business logic related to employee data.

## Quick Start

To get the full application running, you need to start both the backend server and the frontend development server in separate terminals.

1.  **Start the Backend:**
    *   Navigate to the `backend` directory.
    *   Follow the instructions in the `backend/README.md` to set up the database, configure the environment, and start the server.

2.  **Start the Frontend:**
    *   Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
    *   Follow the instructions in the `frontend/README.md` to install dependencies and start the development server.

Once both are running, you can access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:5173`.
